MoonMoney
Hello! This is my editing done on an app called MoonMoney. This app allows users to watch a video in turn for some points.
The points are then used to buy giftcards. My task for this project was to implement the button displaying an add and implementing
the coins system!

If you would like to contribute you can fork the project then go to android studio and go to File->New->Project from Version Control-> Github
then copy and past the correct url and program work away!

Happy Programming!
